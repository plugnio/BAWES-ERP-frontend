## Issues Found

1. **Type Safety**
   - [x] Added proper type guards for API responses
   - [x] Fixed void response handling
   - [ ] Need to add Zod validation schemas
   - [x] Fixed auth component type errors

2. **Dependencies**

## Questions for Backend Team
1. What are the exact response types for each API endpoint?
2. Should we handle any specific error cases differently?
3. Are there any planned changes to the API structure?
